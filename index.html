          <h1>Rotterdam, 29 May 2015</h1>
          <p>Welcome to Joy of Coding! A one-day conference celebrating the art, craft, science and joy of software development.</p>
          <p>The next edition will be held 29 May 2015 at the Van Nelle ontwerpfabriek in Rotterdam. Reasons why <em>you</em> should attend:</p>

            <p>We're not happy unless you go home after Joy of Coding feeling inspired and full of new ideas. That's why we're cramming the conference full of renowned speakers, passionate developers like yourself, and (un)sessions that we hope you'll love.</p>

            <p>We know you can't go to every conference every year, but we really want you to come to ours, so we're working to keep the entry price completely reasonable by teaming up with sponsors. Our goal: be the best value for money conference in 2015. Our very-early bird tickets start selling at the meager price of only EUR 128,-!</p>

            <p>Like you, we're a bunch of developers who like going to interesting conferences and meetups. So there will be no commercial agenda or ulterior motive to Joy of Coding. It's just a place where we can all get together and talk about code.</p>

                <p>Cryptography is a staple of the modern web, and most developers don’t make it past “it uses HTTPS, so it must be secure, right?”. In 30 minutes, I will show you how what you need to <em>understand</em> to make your web application secure, and explain everything you need to know about the file types used in public key infrastructure. Note: this talk is certified math-free.</p>
                <p>Angelo is a Fellow and Software Architect at Luminis, where he focuses on connected devices, security, and is a firm believer in the power of service design and simplicity in software. The main thing that binds his projects is that all have a "twist", be it in hardware, scale, or security requirements. Angelo is an Apache committer on the Apache ACE project, and has spoken at conferences such as Apachecon and Oredev. He is a frequent flyer at hands-on sessions such as those of Devnology and Agile Holland.</p>

                <p>The challenge of modelling and balancing the economy of a large scale game is one of the biggest problems game developers face and one that many have tried to solve by simply throwing man-hours at it... But there's a better way!</p>
                <p>Learn how Gamesys did it by leveraging graph database Neo4j to model the in-game economy of our MMORPG "Here Be Monsters" and automate the balancing process. We'll discuss lessons learned, successes and challenges, and how a graph database enables our small team of game designers to stay agile and focused on delivering new content to players.</p>
                <p>Yan works as a server side developer at Gamesys where he develops scalable backend services for Gamesys's social games on mobile and Facebook. He's a co-author of the upcoming book F# Deep Dives for Manning Publishing. He's a regular speaker on topics such as Aspect-Oriented Programming, F# and NoSQL, and he keeps an active blog at <a href="http://theburningmonk.com/">http://theburningmonk.com/</a></p>

                <p>Everyone knows that, you have that one idea, it might be the next facebook or just the thing somehow nobody build yet but you are dying for it. So what does a programmer do? Right, going to build it. We are makers, builders we have the powers to create our own tooling and make our dreams come true! But somehow only a very few of these ideas actually will ever see a production environment. Contrary to popular belief, some ship! And this is the story how I shipped my pet project!</p>
                <p>Ole Michaelis is the co-founder of <a href="http://2015.socoded.com">SoCoded</a>, a hackfest and web development conference in Hamburg. He’s a Software Engineer at Jimdo, a DIY website creator, where he focuses on backend development. In his free time, he’s building <a href="http://slidr.io">slidr.io</a>, a hazzle-free slide sharing platform. Ole is passionate about open source software, enjoys traveling, and loves Mexican food. He classifies himself as a 'bad' German as he dislikes beer and soccer – the traditional German past-times.</p>

                </a>-->
                <p>Functional programming is currently booming. This is partly driven by the growing number of hybrid languages like Scala or F#. But even if you are not directly interested in one of these languages, you can benefit from looking into functional programming: It widens the horizon and can provide new stimuli for developers working in an object-oriented or procedural environment.</p>
                <p>In this talk, I will demonstrate the basic aspects of functional programming languages, showing examples in Haskell and JavaScript, and I will point out what is so special about functional programming.</p>
                <p>Nicole Rauch is an independent software developer and development coach with a solid background in compiler construction and formal methods. Over the last three years, she worked on the restructuring of large legacy code applications with different technologies. She is also involved in the development of a web platform in node.js. Nonetheless, her secret love is for functional programming. Alongside her occupation as developer, she took part in conducting a number of self-organized conferences related to software craftsmanship and agile coaching. She is also one of the initiators of <a href="https://www.softwerkskammer.org/">Softwerkskammer</a>, the german-speaking Software Craftsmanship community.</p>

                <p>HAL, Skynet, KITT… we’ve always been intrigued by artificial intelligence, but have you ever stopped to considered the un-artificial?</p>
                <p>Most developers are familiar with the basics of AI: how do you make a computer, an algorithm, a system learn something? How do you model real world problems in such a way that an artificial mind can process them? What most don't realize though is that the same principles can be applied to people.</p>
                <p>This talk looks at some of the theories behind how machines learn versus how people learn, and maps it to real life examples of how specifically our users learn their way around interfaces and how designers and developers apply learning methodologies in their day-to-day actions.</p>
                <p>Melinda Seckington is a Ruby developer at <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a>, a social learning platform. She loves attending and hacking at Hackdays, BarCamps and other tech meet ups, and since 2009 has been organising them at <a href="http://geeksoflondon.com/">Geeks of London</a>, including HACKED at the O2 last year. She also is the founder of <a href="http://missgeeky.com">MissGeeky.com</a>, a blog about all things geeky and girly.</p>

                <p>Most unit/integration testing as we know it is example-based: we describe examples of how the code under test behaves in our favourite testing framework.</p>
                <p>Property based testing is a new and promising approach to automated unit testing. It is very different from example-based approaches: in property based testing, you don't write examples but you describe properties of the code under test (statements about the outputs based on the inputs). Based on this, a property-based test framework generates many different inputs and checks if the code under test satisfies everything.</p>
                <p>It started in QuickCheck in the functional programming language Haskell and currently frameworks are available for many languages, from Java/Scala to C++.</p>
                <p>Property based testing forces you to think carefully about specifications: what are the preconditions, postconditions, invariants? It looks like a useful new tool for the crafts(wo)man's tool chest. This session will give you a good impression of how it works and what possible applications could be.</p>

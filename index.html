            <p>We know you can't go to every conference every year, but we really want you to come to ours, so we're working to keep the entry price completely reasonable by teaming up with sponsors. Our goal: be the best value for money conference in 2015. Our very-early bird tickets start selling at the meager price of only EUR 128,-!</p>

                <div class="talk-details">

                  <p>Even the best test suites can't entirely prevent nasty surprises: race conditions, unexpected interactions, faults in distributed protocols and so on, still slip past them into production. Yet writing even more tests of the same kind quickly runs into diminishing returns. I'll talk about new automated techniques that can dramatically improve your testing, letting you focus on what your code should do, rather than which cases should be tested--with plenty of war stories from the likes of Ericsson, Volvo Cars, and Basho Technologies, to show how these new techniques really enable us to nail the hard stuff. And best of all—it’s fun!</p>

                  <p>John Hughes has been a functional programming enthusiast for more than thirty years, at the Universities of Oxford, Glasgow, and since 1992 Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden. He served on the Haskell design committee, co-chairing the committee for Haskell 98, and is the author of more than 75 papers, including <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=why+functional+programming+matters">"Why Functional Programming Matters"</a>, one of the classics of the area. With Koen Claessen, he created QuickCheck, the most popular testing tool among Haskell programmers, and in 2006 he founded Quviq to commercialise the technology using Erlang. Along the way he’s learned to take great joy in buggy code.</p>

              <!--<p>Recipient of the 2006 Gordon Pask award from the Agile community. Divides his attention between assisting Agile teams and the Institut Agile project.</p>-->
                  <p>Here's a guilty secret of programming: a little debugging is a lot of fun. Granted, too much debugging can be the opposite of fun. Therein lies a mystery: why can't we ever seem to write *just the right amount* of bugs? The discipline tasked with answering these questions, known as Software Engineering has for the past four decades (and a bit) managed to ignore some fundamental facts about programming, such as why a little debugging can be a lot of fun, and more interestingly where bugs come from in the first place. Laurent's talk reveals some dismal truths about this sad state of affairs, but also offers more uplifting suggestions on how we can bring tons of fun back into programming, by developing new skills such as leprechaun hunting and brain debugging.</p>

                <div class="talk-details">
             
                <p>Back in the 1940s, a French writer called Raymond Queneau wrote an interesting book with the title Exercises in Style featuring 99 renditions of the exact same short story, each written in a different style. In my book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371">"Exercises in Programming Style"</a> I shamelessly do the same for a simple program. From monolithic to object-oriented to continuations to relational to publish/subscribe to monadic to aspect-oriented to map-reduce, and much more, you will get a tour through the richness of human computational thought by means of implementing one simple program in many different ways. This is more than an academic exercise; large-scale systems design feeds on these ways of thinking. I will talk about the dangers of getting trapped in just one or two prescribed styles during your career, and the need to truly understand this wide variety of concepts when architecting software. </p>

                  <p>The challenge of modelling and balancing the economy of a large scale game is one of the biggest problems game developers face and one that many have tried to solve by simply throwing man-hours at it... But there's a better way!</p>
                  <p>Learn how Gamesys did it by leveraging graph database Neo4j to model the in-game economy of our MMORPG "Here Be Monsters" and automate the balancing process. We'll discuss lessons learned, successes and challenges, and how a graph database enables our small team of game designers to stay agile and focused on delivering new content to players.</p>

                  <p>In most disciplines built on skill and knowledge, from art to architecture, from creative writing to structural engineering, there is a strong emphasis on studying existing work. Exemplary pieces from past and present are examined and discussed in order to provoke thinking and learn techniques for the present and the future. Although programming is a discipline with a very large canon of existing work to draw from, the only code most programmers read is the code they maintain. They rarely look outside the code directly affecting their work. This talk examines some examples of code that are interesting because of historical significance, profound concepts, impressive technique, exemplary style or just sheer geekiness.</p>

                  <p>You will need a windows machine (a VM on OSx has worked for many people) with F# installed . A mouse will come handy too because we have an editor where clicking things is necessary.</p>
                  <p>This is an ideal way to try some F# and/or game development.</p>

                  <p>Conferences and meetups are a great way to learn more, so I try to help when I can to make them happen.</p>
                  <p>I worked on enterprise (not the one with Piccard sadly) for too many years and then we created the company where we now make games, the future unknown.</p>

                  <p>Functional programming is currently booming. This is partly driven by the growing number of hybrid languages like Scala or F#. But even if you are not directly interested in one of these languages, you can benefit from looking into functional programming: It widens the horizon and can provide new stimuli for developers working in an object-oriented or procedural environment.</p>
                  <p>In this talk, I will demonstrate the basic aspects of functional programming languages, showing examples in Haskell and JavaScript, and I will point out what is so special about functional programming.</p>

                  <p>HAL, Skynet, KITT… we’ve always been intrigued by artificial intelligence, but have you ever stopped to considered the un-artificial?</p>
                  <p>Most developers are familiar with the basics of AI: how do you make a computer, an algorithm, a system learn something? How do you model real world problems in such a way that an artificial mind can process them? What most don't realize though is that the same principles can be applied to people.</p>
                  <p>This talk looks at some of the theories behind how machines learn versus how people learn, and maps it to real life examples of how specifically our users learn their way around interfaces and how designers and developers apply learning methodologies in their day-to-day actions.</p>

                <div class="talk-details">
                  <p>In this hands-on session we will be working on a rather smelly piece of code which helpfully has a fairly comprehensive suite of automated tests. Refactoring is one of the key skills of Test-Driven Development, and this is your chance to really practice it. The idea is not to rewrite the code from scratch, but rather, by taking small refactoring steps, gradually transform the code into a paragon of readability and elegance.</p>
                  <p>We’ll be stepping into the Coding Dojo together, which is a safe place designed for learning, where it doesn’t matter if we make mistakes. In fact all the code will be thrown away afterwards. You should feel free to experiment, try out different refactoring approaches, and get feedback from your peers. The great thing about this Kata is that since the tests are very good and very quick to run, they will catch every little refactoring mistake you make. You should experience how programming is supposed to be – smooth, calm, and always minutes away from committable code. The last part of the session is the retrospective, when we discuss what we’ve learnt, and how we can apply our new skills in our daily production code.</p>
                  <p>The code kata we’ll be looking at is “Tennis”, and the starting code is available here: https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata. (Java, Python, C++ etc). If you want to practice using your familiar development tools, please download the code and set up a project in advance of the session. Otherwise you can just come and use the cyber-dojo practice environment, which runs in a browser.</p>

                  <p>Most unit/integration testing as we know it is example-based: we describe examples of how the code under test behaves in our favourite testing framework.</p>
                  <p>Property based testing is a new and promising approach to automated unit testing. It is very different from example-based approaches: in property based testing, you don't write examples but you describe properties of the code under test (statements about the outputs based on the inputs). Based on this, a property-based test framework generates many different inputs and checks if the code under test satisfies everything.</p>
                  <p>It started in QuickCheck in the functional programming language Haskell and currently frameworks are available for many languages, from Java/Scala to C++.</p>
                  <p>Property based testing forces you to think carefully about specifications: what are the preconditions, postconditions, invariants? It looks like a useful new tool for the crafts(wo)man's tool chest. This session will give you a good impression of how it works and what possible applications could be.</p>

                  <p>In most disciplines built on skill and knowledge, from art to architecture, from creative writing to structural engineering, there is a strong emphasis on studying existing work. Exemplary pieces from past and present are examined and discussed in order to provoke thinking and learn techniques for the present and the future. Although programming is a discipline with a very large canon of existing work to draw from, the only code most programmers read is the code they maintain. They rarely look outside the code directly affecting their work. This talk examines some examples of code that are interesting because of historical significance, profound concepts, impressive technique, exemplary style or just sheer geekiness.</p>

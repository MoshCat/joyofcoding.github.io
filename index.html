Others have a strong interest in the development process and improvement. That is all fine. There are even specific conferences that target these groups. Some of them are very good.</p><p>And then some of us are in it for the coding experience. For the intrinsic reward of crafting the best possible solutions to difficult problems. For these people, we organise the Joy of Coding.</p><p>Joy of Coding will be a day where you can talk and collaborate with like-minded coders. The conference is not targeted towards a particular language or platform: any software developer who wants to learn, share and improve is invited. There will be some talks and a lot of workshops and discussions.</p></div>

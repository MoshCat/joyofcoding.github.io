      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>It seems to have been a common theme amongst startups to create the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in a language that facilitates rapid prototyping (for example Ruby), and then migrate to the JVM when the application has proved itself and requires more in terms of stability and performance.</p> 
      <p>I’m going to demonstrate that it’s possible to use a static, boiler-plate-heavy language like Java to create a web application in under and hour, in front of your very eyes.  The JVM is a true polyglot platform, and I’m going to show how you can use it to utilise the correct tools for each job, including: angular.js; bootstrap; HTML 5; micro-services; Java-the-language; MongoDB; and Groovy - a fully buzz-word-compliant application.  While I won’t go into each technology in depth. by seeing how the application is put together you’ll get an understanding of the role of each technology and how they work together.</p>
      <p>Yes, live coding, with all attendant danger.</p>

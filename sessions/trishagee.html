      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>You come to conferences, you read blogs, and you hear about new languages that sound interesting. Even useful. But your architects or operations guys or senior management won’t let you try a “risky” new technology in your nice, stable application.</p>
      <p>What do you do? Do you abandon your dreams of making it all better with Scala? Do you go home and play with Clojure in a pet project on your spare time? How do you know if these tools will live up to your expectations in a Real Life Environment?</p>
      <p>In this talk, Trisha will show the real world example of how the MongoDB Java Driver team use Groovy - in a library that, when built, cannot contain additional dependencies, and must run in plain Java runtime environments.</p>
      <p>How? By cheating, and using Gradle for building and Spock for testing, this Java team got to use a new JVM language in anger with the goal of making their lives easier. And it worked. Mostly.</p>

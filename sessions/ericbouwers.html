      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>As software engineers, we spend most of our working days designing, building, testing and supporting software systems. Although certainly fun and joyful, there are unfortunately situations in which we find ourselves with problems we cannot solve on our own. Or even worse, we find ourselves in a situation in which we know a solution, but cannot convince our colleagues or employers that this solution will help!</p>
      <p>Fortunately, there are thousands of researchers all over the world studying this phenomenon of software engineering. These people perform experiments and case-studies, and publish the results of these studies in order to advance the current state of the art and make sure we are able to improve the way we do software engineering.</p>
      <p>When was the last time you read or used something research has introduced? In many cases, the answer to this question is downright 'never'.</p>
      <p>In this session, we will discuss why so many software engineers do not know about software engineering research, why you should care about the work researchers do, and, more importantly, how you can use the techniques used by researchers in making a better case for your solution. At the end, you will have a better understanding of the research world as a whole, and have practical pointers for making your own programming more joyful.</p>

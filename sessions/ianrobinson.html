      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>Graphs are one of the best abstractions we have for modelling connectedness. Graph databases, in turn, are one of the best tools at our disposal for modelling, storing and querying complex, densely-connected data. Today, graphs and graph databases are helping solve some of the world's most challenging data problems, in domains as diverse as search, social networking, recommendations, datacentre management, logistics, entitlements and authorization, route finding, network monitoring, and fraud analysis.</p>
      <p>In this workshop we'll take a peek inside the graphista's toolbox. We'll look at some common graph data structures, and the graph database queries that unleash the insights buried inside them. We'll survey some of the tools and techniques you can use to graph your world, experiment with graph data, and apply it in your own applications. And we'll draw lots of circles and lines. We might even colour some of them in.</p>

      	<p>Ian works on research and development for future versions of the Neo4j graph database. Harbouring a long-held interest in connected data, he was for many years one of the foremost proponents of REST architectures, before turning his focus from the Web's global graph to the realm of graph databases. As Neo Technologyâ€™s Director of Customer Success, he has worked extensively with customers to design and develop graph database solutions. He is a coauthor of 'Graph Databases' and 'REST in Practice' (O'Reilly), and a contributor to 'REST: From Research to Practice' (Springer) and 'Service Design Patterns' (Addison-Wesley).

<h1>Killing me softly - with this Pair</h1>

<p>This session demonstrates how to effectively ruin a pair-programming session. Shocking to those who can't take a joke, thought-provoking to those who like to think out-of-the-box, hilarious for the rest of the family.</p>
<p>Pair-programming is one of the key practices in eXtreme Programming. While worshipped by some and booed by others, nice, sensible, politically-correct folks (that is, everyone in this field) will qualify Pair-Programming as “something useful, but not always.”</p>
<p>During this session, we will focus on those less happy moments – the “not-always” – where the coder would rather not pair-program, while by the most extraordinary coincidence s/he has been assigned the company of a teammate, forcing her/him to share both work- and thinkspace.</p>
<p>By the means of a totally anti-educational playlet, we hope to act as droll-models and show how to effectively kill any virtuous dynamics that might spur from practicing Pair-Programming. And, by doing so, to help those in desperate need to claim back their peace and loneliness.</p>

	<p>Emmanuel works as a team coach, (extreme) programmer, facilitator, trainer and systems jiggler. For the last 9 years he has been helping software makers to be better at, prouder of, and happier about the work they produce.
A regular speaker at many conferences on Agility, Emmanuel also co-organizes the annual <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.agileopenfrance.com/">Agile Open France conference</a>. He is one of the founder (and still assiduous member) of the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.agile-france.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DojoDeveloppement">Coding Dojo in Paris</a>. Emmanuel works in Paris at <a target="_blank" href="http://ut7.fr">/ut7</a>, a co-operated business he learns to hack with his fellow colleagues. He currently focuses his energy and passion on learning and teaching exotic languages, on shaping self-organizing structures and setting up co-learning spaces.</p>

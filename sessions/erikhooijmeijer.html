      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>Is your web application secure? How can you tell?</p>
      <p>This workshop gives you an opportunity to experience your own web application from the Dark Side, from the perspective of a hacker. Forget about functional requirements, these two hours we will be exploring ways to break and abuse your application.</p>
      <p>We will be using the 2013 OWASP Top 10 as a guideline for finding vulnerabilities and a broad set of tools in neatly prepared virtual machine, ready to be used.</p>
      <p>You'll have fun tweaking HTTP requests, stealing session cookies and injecting all kinds of stuff into your web app. There will be some brute forcing and fuzzing as well :)</p>
      <p>For those of you that cannot bring their own web application we will provide one with plenty of holes.</p>
      <p><b>Practicalities:</b> please bring a laptop or pair with someone. Make sure you have VirtualBox (<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>) installed. Make sure you can run your web-app locally.</p>

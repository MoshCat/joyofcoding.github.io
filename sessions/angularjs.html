<h1>Enjoying client-side development with AngularJS</h1>

<p>There are a lot of Javascript frameworks out there, some good, some bad. There are so many of them, that it is probably safe to say that most &lt;word&gt;.js combinations are already taken :)</p>
<p>How to pick one of them for your (or your clients') next application? Most of them can build the <a target="_blank" href="http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/">TodoMVC</a> application in no-time. But how does it hold up when implementing a real application? You can only find out by using the framework in ways that go beyond the regular tutorials.</p>
<p>In this 2 hour hands-on session you are going to get started with application development in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>.</p>

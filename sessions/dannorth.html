      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>&ldquo;The fastest teams I've ever worked with have been agile. Not
      big-A, all-about-the-TDD, automate-everything,
      methodology-over-thinking Agile, but
      quietly-getting-on-with-business, delivering-the-goods,
      making-the-trade-offs agile. Think agile manifesto over agile
      methodology. It turns out the things I thought were great agile
      practices, while useful in certain circumstances, are by no
      means the whole story. Kaizen, or continuous improvement, must
      be coupled with kaikaku, or abrupt change, in order to avoid
      getting stuck in the local maximum of 1990s Agile methods. This
      talk is about how really high-performing teams work. Not just
      one or two flukes but enough that there might be something to
      it. The patterns and ideas in this talk are genuine experiences
      from active practitioners. This is agile in actuality. Agile is
      an attitude, not a rulebook.&rdquo;</p>

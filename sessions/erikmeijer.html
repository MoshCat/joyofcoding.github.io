      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>Every developer that has ever dealt with contra- and
        covariance in Java or Scala shivers with fear when they have to
        deal with these concepts in their code. Typically the solution
        is to click, click, click, click on the
        'suggested fix' by the IDE until the error messages finally
        go away. All this panic is for nothing since at runtime all 
        generics is erased anyway, and for this reason the Dart
        language made all generic types covariant.</p>

     <p>However, fear no more!</p>

     <p>In this talk we will provide trauma recovery therapy for victims of
        variance by explaining the concepts from first principles
        using real world examples such as vending machines and
        garbage cans. For additional fun, we will throw in
        side-effects and show how the simplest possible covariant and
        contra-variant types are nothing more than the primitive
        collection types Iterator[+T] and Observer[-T]. Add the idea
        of self-application, Iterator[Iterator[T] c.q.
        Observer[Observer[T]], on top of that and we arrive at well
        known types Iterable[+T] and Observable[+T] that we cannot
        not live without.</p>

     <p>And in case you wondered why Scala uses + for covariance and - for
        contravariance, and why a contravariant type in a
        contravariant position becomes a covariant type, well, that
        is all part of the joy of coding.</p>

      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>The Software Engineering Master of Science is a one-year intensive programme at Universiteit van Amsterdam, which is unique in many aspects and specialises in providing solid practical engineering foundations for already experienced software developers. The programme focuses on hands-on activities revolving around constructing reliable software, testing it, benchmarking, collaborating, formulating requirements, comparing various techniques, assessing and choosing languages and technologies.</p>
      <p>In this session, the attendees will be faced with some challenges that we think should be easily overcome by accomplished Masters in software engineering. The participants can then propose their solutions, compare them with one another, openly discuss their advantages and spot their flaws, in the process of embracing the problem, dissecting it and arriving at a satisfying solution. The level of challenges presented will correspond to honours track assignments and exam questions of the actual programme.</p>

      	<p>Vadim Zaytsev, also known as @grammarware, currently works
      	as a lecturer and the coordinator of the Software Engineering
      	Master of Science programme at Universiteit van Amsterdam. He
      	has previously been a researcher at Centrum Wiskunde &
      	Informatica (CWI) and Universit√§t Koblenz, a PhD student at
      	Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, a MSc student in Universiteit
      	Twente, a math student in Russia, a hackers community
      	moderator, a wiki admin, a programming teacher and
      	competition jury, an Assembly coder, a virmaker and some kind
      	of programmer in every language he came across. Besides
      	hardcore software language engineering with grammar(ware)
      	technology, his interests and research activities tend to
      	invade such topics as software quality assessment, source
      	code analysis and transformation, modelling, metamodelling,
      	megamodelling, programming paradigms, declarative and
      	functional programming, dynamic aspects of software
      	languages, maintenance and renovation of legacy systems and
      	others. He is also actively hacking and engineering software,
      	practicing open science, contributing to a range of open data
      	and open source projects, co-organising and presenting at
      	various events. More information can be found at

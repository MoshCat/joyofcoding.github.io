<h1>FP State of Mind</h1>

<p>This workshop aims to teach a "functional mindset", it's for people who have dabbled with FP (functional programming), but are struggling with the switch from OOP to FP.</p>
<p>Although the workshop will use Haskell, its aim is not to teach Haskell. Instead it will focus on how to think "functionally". How do you design programs and how do you solve problems without state, mutable data, and traditional control structures?</p>
<p>We will focus on the use of recursion, higher-order functions, and pattern-matching. Note that monads will not be mentioned (unless participants insist).</p>

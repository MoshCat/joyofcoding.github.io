<h1>The Joy of TDD on the Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>Moore's law also applies to embedded development so we can increasingly use higher level languages: more joy and more productive.</p>
<p>In this session we will add a feature to a soft-drinks vending machine prototype using Raspberry Pi's, an Arduino, Lego and various bits and pieces. Learn how to use test driven development and hexagonal architecture to keep your code clean and your mind sane.</p>
<p>We set out to turn our virtual vending machine exercise into something physical. We underestimated how much fun it would be to work with a tiny low power Linux PC, the Raspberry Pi, together with Lego and a bit of circuitry.</p>
<p>Join us in this session and feel the joy of Test Driven Development and messing about with actual hardware.</p>

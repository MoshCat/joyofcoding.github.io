<p>"My name is Johan and I code badly. I'm here with you to work on my bad coding habits, I still have lots of them. Today lets work on our procedural habits as object oriented developers!"</p>
<p>Practicing with constraints is absolutely essential to progressing quickly, in fact I'd argue that good code doesn't mainly come from having time to write it correctly, but taking time to practice so that producing great code becomes fast and natural.</p>
<p>Lets practice Object Calisthenics on some utterly procedural code and see what we learn and how it turns out!</p>

<h1>Testing and refactoring Legacy Code</h1>

<p>Many of us are now working with large Object Oriented systems which have grown very complex and with no or very few tests. In this full live coding session, Sandro will be taking a piece of crappy Java code and while ripping it apart, he will be demonstrating some techniques that will help us overcome the most common challenges of testing legacy code and also what we need to have in mind when refactoring towards a better design.</p>

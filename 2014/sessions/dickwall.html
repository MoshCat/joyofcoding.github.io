      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>When you are coding, do you ever have the sense that perhaps
      something is missing? While most of us code for the love of it,
      there are always those times that you succumb to compromise,
      but is that really a bad thing?</p>

        <p>When I was asked to give this talk, I accepted based mostly on the
        title of the conference. Other technical conferences tend to
        name specific technical goals in their titles, or else target
        themselves to a specific field, language or community. What
        captured my imagination about the Joy of Coding is that
        title, and the question that goes with it. What is it about
        coding that gives us joy? What more noble pursuit can there
        be than enjoying our work at the same time we derive pride
        from it?</p>

        <p>Perhaps those times that you feel slightly less than fulfilled, the
        answer you seek is not a technical one, but a philosophical
        one.</p>

        <p>In seeking the very latest ways to improve your skills and abilities
        as a creator of code, instead of looking forwards, we might
        learn something by looking back. Back around 530 BC, a man
        called Lao-Tzu (or Laozi, both of which are actually
        inaccurate translations of the real thing) wrote a book of
        just 5000 chinese characters in around 81 verses, providing
        insight that is still valuable today. To put that into our
        terms, perhaps we would compare it to 5000 lines of code in
        81 source files that are still relevant and useful more than
        2500 years after they were written down, having been ported
        to numerous new systems along the way.</p>

        <p>In this talk, I will select some of the expressions from this amazing
        feat of engineering, and look at what we might learn from
        them in order to improve our own skills and attitude towards
        software development. We might even have a few laughs along
        the way.</p>

      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>Code coverage is a blunt tool that says very little about the quality of your test suite. Mutation testing on the other hand is very informative.</p>
      <p>In this workshop we'll talk about the basis of mutation testing, what tools there are out there and how they can fit into your development process. We'll also have some hands-on exercises to show the power of mutation testing techniques, as well as the dangers and costs of them.</p>

      <p><b>Practical notes:</b></p>
      <p>There is a well maintained tool for Java (<a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/">PITest</a>) and a less well maintained tool for .NET (NinjaTurtles). We'll try using both/either, so come with laptops and your favourite IDE (although I will be asking you to work in pairs, sharing a single machine).</p>

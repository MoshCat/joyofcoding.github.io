<h1>The Poutsma Principles</h1>

<p>The name "Poutsma Principle" goes back to a SpringSource engineering meeting that was held in the summer of 2008. While watching a presentation about the API of a new Spring portfolio project that was to be introduced, I blurted out something along the lines of "I don't understand it, and that probably means it is wrong." Later on, the term "Poutsma Principle" remained in use within SpringSource to make sure that our APIs were as simple as possible.</p>
<p>In this talk, I plan to present this first and other Poutsma Principles: essentially things I learned while working on the Spring Framework for over seven years. It is meant to be an interactive session, with lots of discussion, disagreement and more.</p>

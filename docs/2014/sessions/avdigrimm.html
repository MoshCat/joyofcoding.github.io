      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>A big part of my joy in coding is getting to play with cool
      toys. But sometimes in my eagerness to use the coolest toys, I
      overlook tools that are right in front of me. In this session,
      we'll take a second look at a tool that most programmers
      probably have at least a passing familiarity with: Bash. We'll
      push it to its limits, and a little beyond, all in the name of
      science... and fun!</p>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I wish I could connect my lamp to the internet, but I know nothing about all that &amp;lsquo;technology&amp;rsquo; stuff that you do.&amp;rdquo; Sounds familiar? In my workshop I will be teaching the teachers: I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving you the tools to help your non-dev, non-technology-minded relatives have physical objects (lamps, motors, sensors) in their houses interact with the online world. We&amp;rsquo;ll be posting sensor readings on twitter and we&amp;rsquo;ll be activating lamps based on online weather forecasts.</description>

Carin started off as a professional ballet dancer, studied Physics in college, and has been developing software for both the enterprise and entrepreneur ever since. She has a thing for Clojure and can be usually found with a cup of tea in her hand, hacking on her Roomba, AR Drone, or any other robots that happen to be nearby. She hails from Cincinnati, where she works remotely as a developer for Cognitect, and also helps organize the Cincinnati Functional Programmers user group.

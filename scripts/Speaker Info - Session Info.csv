A cellist defends a fortress by improvising on his cello. Melodies control the guns, dissonant notes activate the flamethrowers. Players from the audience use game controllers to steer their tanks and attack the fortress. The cellist plays live music, while at the same time controlling the game to be a fun challenge for the players. Cello Fortress is an innovative experiment that blends concert and game.",

The code will most likely be more consistent, more stable, and easier to maintain. However, sometimes, when you just need to get stuff done, it can be more effective to mix and match.
For example, you want to make use of a fast image processing library written in C++, only you happen to be coding in JavaScript. Or consider the situation where you previously solved a certain problem in R, and now you need to solve that same problem again for a Python-based project. It's situations like these that can take the joy out of coding.
Don't despair. In this talk I discuss several tricks to mix and match both languages and tools so you can get stuff done. What's more, you'll be able to spend more time coding on the truly interesting problems. Joy!",

Clojure, a practical Lisp running on top of the JVM, has already done a lot to increase Lisp’s popularity outside of academic circles. Let’s combine the two to address the remaining doubts about its suitability for the real world! This talk will introduce both the architectural concept and the language, and show how you can combine tools from the Clojure and Java ecosystem to build Clojure-based microservices in practice.",

Emily Bache,"Software developer at Pagero, Author of The Coding Dojo Handbook and (upcoming) Mocks Fakes and Stubs.",http://joyofcoding.org/img/speakers/emilybache.png,Coding Dojo,"In this hands-on session we will be working on a rather smelly piece of code which helpfully has a fairly comprehensive suite of automated tests. Refactoring is one of the key skills of Test-Driven Development, and this is your chance to really practice it. The idea is not to rewrite the code from scratch, but rather, by taking small refactoring steps, gradually transform the code into a paragon of readability and elegance.

We'll be stepping into the Coding Dojo together, which is a safe place designed for learning, where it doesn’t matter if we make mistakes. In fact all the code will be thrown away afterwards. You should feel free to experiment, try out different refactoring approaches, and get feedback from your peers. The great thing about this Kata is that since the tests are very good and very quick to run, they will catch every little refactoring mistake you make. You should experience how programming is supposed to be &mdash; smooth, calm, and always minutes away from committable code.

The last part of the session is the retrospective, when we discuss what we've learnt, and how we can apply our new skills in our daily production code. The code kata we'll be looking at is ""Tennis"", and the starting code is available <a href=""https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata"">here</a>. (Java, Python, C++, etc). If you want to practice using your familiar development tools, please download the code and set up a project in advance of the session.

Of course, since you are devs, after setting up the click and play, no code examples you can share with your relatives, we will dive deeper in the system, changing the firmware on the photon to do our biding, making API calls from our own websites, etc.

Instead they ruin your day (and your productivity) by asking questions and expecting documentation. You need to know how to explain code without getting stuck in meetings or spending half your time on the only thing you hate more than meetings: writing documentation. Instead, you aim for constructive laziness: tactics that give you more time to write code.

This talk teaches you how to avoid writing documentation, by making it unnecessary or delegating the work to someone else. You will also learn how to deal with the awkward situation when you can’t away with avoidance or delegation, and have to write the documentation yourself.

This talk explores what we talk about when we talk about code, how we do it, and the tools we use. You can often find a better tool than documentation, but not always. Not everyone writes detailed specifications these days, but remote working and distributed teams make written explanations more valuable than ever. Talking face to face requires less effort, but you rarely or never meet the authors of most of the code you see. Software craftsmanship has failed to make written documentation unnecessary. Instead we shall turn to README-Driven Development, comments evasion, documentation-avoidance, just-in-time documentation and the art of not writing it in the first place.",OK
